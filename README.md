# DeepLearning-Simple-Implementation
This is a project I wrote during my deep learning class at university. 
This project included derivation of the forward and backward pass of a simple ANN by hand, and then implementing it in code.
Along with that, I implemented a Gradient Descent algorithm which includes : vanilla gradient descent, gradient descent with momentum, stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent with exponential decay.
